# Create GitHub Repository Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is installing, here are two options:

## Option 1: Manual Creation (Quickest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - Repository name: `SHW-Production-Webapp`
   - Description: `Production management system for ShurePrint/Hwood Group teams`
   - Leave "Initialize this repository with:" UNCHECKED
3. Click "Create repository"

## Option 2: Wait for GitHub CLI
Once installed, run:
```bash
gh auth login
gh repo create shurehw/SHW-Production-Webapp --public --description "Production management system for ShurePrint/Hwood Group teams"
```

## After Repository is Created:
Your local git is already configured. Just run:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

This will push all your code to the new repository!
